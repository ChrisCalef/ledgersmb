=item LedgerSMB::DBObject::Payment->new()

Inherited from LedgerSMB::DBObject.  Please see that documnetation for details.

=item $oayment->get_open_accounts()

This function returns a list of open accounts depending on the 
$payment->{account_class} property.  If this property is 1, it returns a list 
of vendor accounts, for 2, a list of customer accounts are returned.

The returned list of hashrefs is stored in the $payment->{accounts} property.
Each hashref has the following keys:  id (entity id), name, and entity_class.

An account is considered open if there are outstanding, unpaid invoices 
attached to it.  Customer/vendor payment threshold is not considered for this 
calculation.

    my ($self) = @_;

    return @{$self->{accounts}};
}

=over

=item $oayment->get_all_accounts()

This function returns a list of open or closed accounts depending on the 
$payment->{account_class} property.  If this property is 1, it returns a list 
of vendor accounts, for 2, a list of customer accounts are returned.

The returned list of hashrefs is stored in the $payment->{accounts} property.
Each hashref has the following keys:  id (entity id), name, and entity_class.

sub get_all_accounts {
    my ($self) = @_;
    @{$self->{accounts}} = 
        $self->exec_method(funcname => 'payment_get_all_accounts');
    return @{$self->{accounts}};
}

=over

=item $oayment->get_open_invoices()

This function returns a list of open invoices depending on the 
$payment->{account_class}, $payment->{entity_id}, and $payment->{currency} 
properties.  Account classes follow the conventions above.  This list is hence
specific to a customer or vendor and currency as well.

The returned list of hashrefs is stored in the $payment->{open_invoices} 
property. Each hashref has the following keys:  id (entity id), name, and 
entity_class.

=cut

sub get_open_invoices {
    my ($self) = @_;
    @{$self->{open_invoices}} = 
        $self->exec_method(funcname => 'payment_get_open_invoices');
    return @{$self->{open_invoices}};
}

=over

=item $oayment->get_all_contact_invoices()

This function returns a list of open accounts depending on the 
$payment->{account_class} property.  If this property is 1, it returns a list 
of vendor accounts, for 2, a list of customer accounts are returned.  Attached
to each account is a list of open invoices.  The data structure is somewhat 
complex.

Each item in the list has the following keys: contact_id, contact_name, \
account_number, total_due, and invoices.

The invoices entry is a reference to an array of hashrefs.  Each of these 
hashrefs has the following keys: invoice_id, invnumber, invoice_date, amount, 
discount, and due.

These are filtered based on the (required) properties:
$payment->{account_class}, $payment->{business_type}, $payment->{date_from},
$payment->{date_to}, and $payment->{ar_ap_accno}.

The $payment->{ar_ap_accno} property is used to filter out by AR or AP account.

The following can also be optionally passed: $payment->{batch_id}.  If this is 
patched, vouchers in the current batch will be picked up as well.

The returned list of hashrefs is stored in the $payment->{contact} property.
Each hashref has the following keys:  id (entity id), name, and entity_class.

=item list_open_projects

This method gets the current date attribute, and provides a list of open
projects.  The list is attached to $self->{projects} and returned.

}

=over
=item list_open_projects

This method gets the type of document as a parameter, and provides a list of departments
of the required type.
The list is attached to $self->{departments} and returned.
