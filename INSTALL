Installing LedgerSMB 1.3


This document contains information on how to install LedgerSMB.  We recommend
that the reader start by reading the section on manual installation and then
start by trying the automated means mentioned later.

Also this document assumes that the reader is already familiar with the release
notes.  If you have not already done so, please read the release_notes file in
the doc/ directory.

MANUAL INSTALL:
===============================================================================

1)  Untar in desired location.

2)  Check Dependencies

The Makefile.PL script can be used to test for unmet dependencies and run other
tests.  It doesn't install anything yet, but it will tell you what you are 
missing.  To check for dependencies, run "perl Makefile.PL" from the command
line.  Missing dependencies can generally be installed via a Linux distributor's
package manager or by CPAN. (Makefile.PL itself uses Module::Install, which is
available in packages like perl-Module-Install or libmodule-install-perl.)

Once this is done and dependencies are satisfied, you can check to see whether
the installation nominally works by running "make test" from the command
line.  The test suites currently check to make sure all the perl modules load
and that a number of numeric tests are passed.

Dependencies which are recommended are needed only for specific functionality
and may not be required in all circumstances.  These include:
  * Net::TCLink for credit card processing in a POS environment
  * Parse::RecDescent for the CLI script host

3)  Decide where to put the user/session management tables.  In general, we
recommend as follows:
  a)  Single dataset installations should use the user tables in the dataset.
  b)  Multi-company installations should use user tables in a separate dataset
      from any accounting data.

4)  Install Tsearch2 Full Text indexing engine for PostgreSQL (not optional)
  a) If you installed PostgreSQL from source, Tsearch2 is in contrib.
  b) If you installed from package, you will need the package
  postgresql-contrib or equivalent
  c) Use psql to apply the tsearch2.sql to template1. The file is normally 
  installed to
  /usr/share/postgresql/contrib/tsearch2.sql or
  //usr/share/postgresql/<version>/contrib/tsearch2.sql

5)  Install tablefunc.sql for PostgreSQL (not optional)
  See notes in 4 above for location of script and apply to template1.

6)  Install pg_trgm.sql into database or template1.
  See notes in 4 above for location of script.  Apply to template1.

7)  Create central database
  a) create the ledgersmb role (optional)
  b) create the ledgersmb database (if using a multi-company central db)
  c) cd to the sql/ directory of the new ledger directory.
  d) load the Pg-database.sql script into ledgersmb or your database.

8)  Set the admin password:
  From psql, determine what admin password you wish to use.  Then type:
      "update users_conf set password = md5('my_password');"
      Naturally you would use your password instead of my_password.

9)  Edit the ledgersmb.conf file as appropriate.

Congratulations, you have manually installed LedgerSMB 1.3.
