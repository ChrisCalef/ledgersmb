-------------------------------
The following PostgreSQL versions suffer from a bug which causes problems with 
LedgerSMB:  8.2.2, 8.1.7, and 8.0.11

These versions produce an error concerning wrong data types but the error shows 
that the data types are indeed correct.

-------------------------------

W3M does not handle the <BUTTON> element properly and does not work.

-------------------------------

Pocket Internet Explorer:
Pocket IE does not handle BUTTON elements so is entirely unsupported.

-------------------------------

Minimo:
Minimo's SSR settings can cause tables to be badly represented.  We recommend 
disabling SSR.  Minimo is the preferred alternative to Pocket IE.

-------------------------------

Internet Explorer < 7.0
This browser submits incorrect data when using the <BUTTON> element and is not
supported.  Users of Windows XP and Vista may try Internet Explorer 7 or 
Firefox at their option. Users of older versions of WIndows should use Firefox.
